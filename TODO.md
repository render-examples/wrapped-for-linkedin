# TODO

- Show top 5 posts, see if we can get previews from URLs
- Top follower demographics (locations, industries, etc)
- Bonus: Show mini calendar of follower activity
- Redesign app with LinkedIn Wrapped text in top left or top center smaller to focus attention on the actual content
- Create a nice animation on the LinkedIn Wrapped text
- Use Scribe to document screenshot steps for users to download their LinkedIn metrics, or find a way to do so automatically
	- All users would need to do is enter their username or paste their profile URL and have RegEx extract the username?
