# TODO

- Still need to fix or remove top post wrapped card! Looks terrible
- Remove hover movement from instructions buttons, make buttons same side
- Share on LinkedIn should open new tab, not new popup window
- Create 2 different sets of posting instructions for single image vs PDF carousel

Later improvements:
- Fix weird lack of text spacing in PDF exports
- Ensure all wrapped card elements stay visible in mobile view and when webpage changes
- Add screenshots to posting instructions at the end showing final copy, edited in Canva
- Update docs with new instructions on bin preview and usage
- Remove unused code
